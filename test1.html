            and validation folders) and two subfolders containing pneumonia (P) and normal(N) chest X-ray images, respectively. A total of 5,856 X-ray images of anterior-posterior chests were carefully chosen from retrospective paediatric patients between
            1 and 5 years old. Method used: convolutional neural network model trained from scratch to classify and detect the presence of pneumonia from a collection of chest X-ray image samples Results: The final results obtained are training loss=0.1288,
            training accuracy = 0.9531, validation loss: 0.1835, and validation accuracy of 0.9373. Citation: Stephen, Okeke, et al. "An efficient deep learning approach to pneumonia classification in healthcare." Journal of healthcare engineering 2019
